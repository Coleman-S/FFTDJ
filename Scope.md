# Scope Document: Music Visualizer with Physics-Based Effects

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Name:** Music Visualizer with Physics-Based Effects  
**Description:** A real-time web application that transforms live or pre-recorded audio into dynamic 2D and 3D visualizations by coupling audio analysis (FFT) with physics simulations (particle systems and fluid dynamics).  
**Monetization Potential:** Web-based subscription, integration into DJ software, VJ performance licensing.

## 2. Objectives
- Develop a responsive real-time visualizer that reacts to audio input in both 2D and 3D.  
- Implement at least two physics-based effects: 3D fluid simulation (Navier–Stokes) and 3D particle system.  
- Provide customizable parameters (e.g., viscosity, particle count, force intensity, depth).  
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility via web technologies (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
- Deploy as a web application accessible via modern browsers.  
- Demonstrate performance benchmarks (60 FPS at 1080p in 3D mode).

## 3. Scope
### In-Scope
- Real-time audio input via microphone, line-in, or audio file playback (MP3, WAV).  
- FFT-based frequency analysis for multiple bands.  
- Physics modules in both 2D and 3D:  
  - Grid-based fluid simulation (Navier–Stokes solver).  
  - Particle emitter systems.  
- UI for selecting effects, switching between 2D/3D, and tuning parameters.  
- Export visual output as video or GIF.  
- Preset management for common scenarios (e.g., DJ set, ambient visuals).

### Out-of-Scope
- Mobile platforms (iOS/Android) in initial release.  
- Advanced multi-channel audio (surround sound).  
- Cloud-based rendering or streaming services.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. **Audio Input Module**  
   - Capture live audio streams and load audio files.  
   - Perform windowed FFT (e.g., 1024-sample windows) via Web Audio API.

2. **Visualization Engine**  
   - **Fluid Simulation (2D/3D):**  
     - Implement Navier–Stokes solver with finite differences and pressure projection.  
     - Inject forces based on FFT band magnitudes.  
   - **Particle System (2D/3D):**  
     - Emit and animate particles with attributes (size, color, lifespan) influenced by audio.

3. **User Interface**  
   - WebGL canvas for real-time preview.  
   - Controls for:  
     - Effect selection (fluid vs. particles).  
     - Dimension toggle (2D/3D) and depth controls.  
     - Parameter sliders (viscosity, force scale, particle count).  
   - Preset save/load functionality.

4. **Export & Integration**  
   - Record and export sessions to video/GIF.  
   - Provide a plugin or API interface for third-party integration (e.g., DJ software).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** ≥ 60 FPS at 1080p in 3D on mid-range GPUs.  
- **Latency:** Audio-to-visual latency ≤ 100 ms.  
- **Scalability:** Support audio sample rates up to 48 kHz.  
- **Usability:** Intuitive UI with real-time feedback.  
- **Maintainability:** Modular codebase in JavaScript/TypeScript.  
- **Portability:** Deployable as a web application accessible in modern browsers.

## 6. Technical Approach
- **Language & Frameworks:** JavaScript/TypeScript with Three.js or Babylon.js (WebGL).  
- **Audio Processing:** Web Audio API and JavaScript FFT library (e.g., dsp.js or custom WebAssembly FFT).  
- **Physics Engine:** Custom Navier–Stokes solver; particle system with spatial hashing for performance.  
- **UI:** HTML/CSS/JS, optional React for control panels; WebGL canvas for rendering.  
- **Build & Deployment:** Node.js, NPM, Webpack; CI/CD via GitHub Actions; hosting on a secure HTTPS static site or PWA.
